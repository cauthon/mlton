The patch simd-not.patch will patch simd-word.sml and simd-word.sig to include
the notb function. When using a basis library compiled with the simd-word notb
instruction any program using simd instructions(via including the simd.mlb file
in an mlb file) will fail to compile from an uncaught option exception in the
ssa-to-rssa pass. Its worth noting that it doesn't matter if the simd not
function is actually using, mearly including the simd.mlb file is enough to
trigger the error.
